            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">1) Discuss the scope of <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and
                <code>const</code>.
            </h1>
            <p>
                `var`, `let`, and `const` are three keywords used for declaring variables in JavaScript, and they have
                different scopes and behaviors. Understanding their scope is crucial for writing robust and maintainable
                code.

                <br><br>

                1. `var`:
                - Function-scoped: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, which means they are only
                accessible within the function in which they are defined.
                - Hoisting: `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This
                means you can access a `var` variable before it's declared, but it will be `undefined` until the
                declaration is encountered in the code.
                - No block scope: Unlike `let` and `const`, `var` does not have block-level scope. It is accessible
                anywhere within the function it's declared in.

                <br><br>

                Example:

            <pre>

                    function exampleFunction() {
                        if (true) {
                        var x = 10;
                        }
                        console.log(x); // Outputs 10, even though 'x' was declared inside the 'if' block
                    }

            </pre>

            2. `let`:
            - Block-scoped: Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible
            within the nearest enclosing block (e.g., a loop, conditional statement, or function).
            - Hoisting: Like `var`, `let` declarations are also hoisted but are not initialized with a value. They
            are in a "temporal dead zone" until they are declared in the code.

            <br><br>

            Example:

            <pre>

                function exampleFunction() {
                    if (true) {
                    let y = 20;
                    console.log(y); // Outputs 20
                    }
                    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined, because 'y' is block-scoped
                }

            </pre>


            3. `const`:
            - Block-scoped: Variables declared with `const` are also block-scoped, just like `let`.
            - Immutability: Variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned after they are declared. However,
            for objects and arrays declared with `const`, their properties or elements can still be modified.

            <br><br>

            Example:

            <pre>

                const z = 30;
                z = 40; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
    
                const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
                myArray.push(4); // This is allowed
                myArray = [4, 5, 6]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

            </pre>

            <br><br>

            In summary, the scope of `var` is function-level, `let` and `const` have block-level scope, and `const`
            additionally enforces immutability for the variable itself (though not necessarily for its contents in
            the case of objects and arrays). It's generally recommended to use `let` and `const` over `var` for
            better scoping and avoiding unexpected behaviors in your JavaScript code.

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">2) Tell us the use cases of <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>
            </h1>

            <p>
                `null` and `undefined` are two distinct values in JavaScript, and they have different use cases:

                <br><br>

                <strong>
                    1. null:
                </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Intentional Absence of Value: `null` is often used to represent the intentional absence of any
                    object value or value that is explicitly set to "nothing" or "empty."
                </li>

                <li>Explicit Assignment: Developers can assign `null` to variables or properties to indicate that
                    there is no meaningful value or that a variable has been intentionally cleared.
                </li>

                <li>Common Use Cases: It can be used in scenarios like resetting a variable, indicating that an object
                    property has no value, or as a placeholder for a value that hasn't been initialized yet.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            Example:

            <pre>

                    let someValue = null; // Explicitly set to represent absence of a value
                    let person = {
                        name: null, // The 'name' property may not have a value initially
                        age: 30
                    };
            </pre>

            <br><br>

            <strong>
                2. undefined:
            </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Default Value: Variables that are declared but have not been assigned any value are
                    automatically
                    initialized to `undefined`. It's JavaScript's way of indicating that a variable has been declared
                    but
                    has not been given a meaningful value yet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Function Return**: If a function does not return any value explicitly, it returns `undefined` by
                    default.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Property Access**: Accessing an object property that does not exist returns `undefined`.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            Example:

            <pre>

                let uninitializedVariable; // initialized to 'undefined'
    
                function noReturnValueFunction() {
                // No 'return' statement, so it returns 'undefined' by default
                }
    
                let obj = {
                    name: "John",
                    age: 30
                };
    
                console.log(obj.address); // Accessing a non-existent property returns 'undefined'
            </pre>

            <br><br>

            In summary, `null` is typically used when you want to explicitly indicate the absence of a value, while
            `undefined` is often used by JavaScript itself to indicate uninitialized variables or properties.
            Understanding the distinction between these two values is essential to avoid unexpected behavior in your
            code and to communicate your intentions regarding the presence or absence of values in your data
            structures.

        <article class="shadow-xl p-10 mb-20">
            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">3) What do you mean by REST API?</h1>

            <p>
                REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set
                of architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications. It is a style of web
                services that uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources,
                where each resource is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator). REST is often used in the
                context of web services, and it is a popular choice for building APIs due to its simplicity and
                scalability.

                <br><br>

                Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:

                <br><br>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Statelessness:</strong>
                    Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to
                    understand and process the request. The server should not store any client state between requests.
                    This
                    makes RESTful services highly scalable and easy to manage.

                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Client-Server Architecture</strong>
                    REST separates the client (the user interface) from the server (the
                    application logic and data storage). This separation allows for better scalability and flexibility,
                    as
                    clients and servers can evolve independently.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Uniform Interface</strong>
                    RESTful APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, which is typically based
                    on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
                    Resources are identified by URLs and manipulated using these methods.

                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Resource-Based</strong>
                    In REST, resources are the key abstractions. Resources can be anything that needs
                    to be represented and manipulated, such as objects, data, or services. Each resource is identified
                    by a
                    unique URL.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Representation</strong>
                    Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or others.
                    Clients interact with these representations to perform actions on the resource.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stateless Communication</strong>
                    RESTful interactions are stateless, meaning that each request from the
                    client to the server must contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and
                    process
                    the request. Sessions and client state are typically managed on the client side.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Layered System</strong>
                    REST allows for a layered architecture, where intermediaries (e.g., load
                    balancers, caching servers) can be placed between clients and servers to improve performance,
                    scalability, and security.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br><br>

            RESTful APIs are commonly used for various purposes, including web services, mobile app backends, and
            IoT (Internet of Things) applications. They are known for their simplicity, scalability, and
            compatibility with the HTTP protocol, making them a popular choice for building APIs that enable
            communication between different software systems over the internet.
